Lorenz model implementation for team's performance and behaviour
# 🌪️ Lorenz Attractor Simulator for Team Performance

This interactive application allows you to visualize the famous **Lorenz attractor** and explore how its parameters can be interpreted in the context of **team performance**.

## 🎯 What can you do with this app?

- Adjust the parameters of the Lorenz system:
  - **Sigma (σ)**: Emotional positivity of the team.
  - **Rho (ρ)**: Level of connectivity and collaboration.
  - **Beta (β)**: Presence of negative emotions or energy loss.
- Observe how these values affect the team's dynamics:
  - Low performance (point attractor)
  - Medium performance (limit cycle)
  - High performance (chaotic attractor)

## 🧠 Inspired by:
- Edward Lorenz's model (1963)
- Organizational applications by Marcial Losada and Emily Heaphy on team dynamics and meta-learning.

## 🚀 How to use it?

1. Adjust the values in the sidebar.
2. Observe how the system's trajectory changes.
3. Interpret the result to reflect on your team's state.
